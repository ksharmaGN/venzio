/**

 *
 * Two properties of the ladder are the argument, and neither is convenience.
 * First, it is PUSH-ONLY BY DESIGN: it writes no `notifications` row, because a
 * nudge to go home is worthless an hour later and a bell full of "still checked
 * in?" from last Tuesday is a bell nobody opens - which costs them the approval
 * notices that do matter. `notify()` cannot express "no feed row"; writing the
 * row unconditionally is the whole point of step 3 of its contract. Second, the
 * ladder resolves its schedule from ONE bulk read per batch (see below), where
 * `notify()` resolves preferences per call - 500 events would be 500 lookups.
 *
 * The preference check `notify()` exists to centralise is not being skipped, it
 * has moved: having a rung set at all IS the opt-in, so a member with no row
 * generates no rungs and this loop sends them nothing. There is no switch left
 * to forget to consult.
