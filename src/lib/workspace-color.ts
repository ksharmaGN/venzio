/**
 * Deterministic swatch tint. The same workspace always gets the same colour on
 * every device without storing one, which is what makes the pill recognisable
 * at a glance in the switcher.
 *
 * Extracted from `MeTopbar` so the workspace pill and the workspace badge on a
 * unified notification row agree. Two copies of this function would drift the
 * moment either palette is touched, and a badge whose colour disagrees with the
 * pill is worse than no badge at all: it teaches the wrong association.
 *
 * Always seed on the workspace **id**, never the slug - a workspace can be
 * renamed (and re-slugged); its id is stable, so its colour is too.

 * there. What was NOT acceptable is the previous state, where this hash existed
