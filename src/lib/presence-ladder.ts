/**
 * The open-session ladder: which pushes an open check-in earns, and when.
 *
 * PURE. No database access, no imports from `src/lib/db/**`, no React - exactly
 * like `src/lib/hierarchy.ts` and `src/lib/parental.ts`, and here for the same
 * sharp reason as the latter rather than for tidiness. The `/me/settings` screen
 * that edits these values is a CLIENT component and needs the bounds below at
 * runtime to build its inputs and validate them. If those constants lived in a
 * query file, importing them from that form would pull `lib/db/index.ts` into the
 * browser bundle and with it better-sqlite3 and libSQL - a build failure whose
 * error is a long `Can't resolve 'fs'` trace naming none of that. `import type`
 * is erased and is always safe; a runtime import is not. So anything both the
 * form and the cron need lives here, and the query file re-exports it for its own
 * callers.
 *
 * The locale module IS imported, and that is not a contradiction: a locale module
 * is plain data with no transitive dependency on the database, and `resolveLadder`
 * has to fill each rung's title and body from somewhere. Writing the copy inline
 * would put user-facing strings outside `src/locales/` (invariant 16).
