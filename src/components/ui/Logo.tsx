/**
 * The Venzio mark.
 *
 * It existed only on the marketing and consent pages until now - neither app
 * shell showed it, so the product a customer signs into carried no brand at all.
 *
 * `next/image` rather than a plain `<img>`, and that is load-bearing:
 * `public/logo.png` is a **6000 x 3375** source of about 866 KB. Shipping it
 * raw into a top bar would be most of a megabyte on every page load. The
 * optimiser resizes and re-encodes it to the rendered size, which is a few KB.
 *
 * Worth fixing properly one day: the source should be an SVG, or a PNG exported
 * at the sizes actually used. Until then the optimiser is doing work on every
 * cold request that an export would have done once.
