/**
 * The member's own session ladder: `GET` to read it, `PATCH` to change it.
 *
 * THERE IS NO WORKSPACE IN THIS PATH, and that is structural rather than an
 * omission. `presence_events` carries no `workspace_id` and deliberately never
 * will, so a member of two workspaces has ONE open check-in session - there is
 * nothing to scope these four numbers to except the account. That is also why it
 * sits at `/api/me/...` rather than `/api/me/ws/[slug]/...`: the sibling
 * reminder schedule IS per workspace, because everything it gates on (timezone,
 * working days, the holiday calendar, approved leave) belongs to a workspace,
 * and putting the two routes side by side would invite someone to "fix" the
 * inconsistency by giving this one a slug it cannot use.
 *
 * The user id comes from `getServerUser()`, i.e. the proxy-set header, never
 * from the body (invariant 1). There is no `userId` field in the contract at
 * all, so there is nothing to forget to ignore.
