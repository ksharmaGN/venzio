/**
 * Where a notification takes you when you tap it.
 *
 * One resolver, three consumers: the `/ws` bell panel, the `/me` notification
 * list, and the push payloads themselves (`data.url`, honoured by the service
 * worker's `notificationclick`). Before this existed each of them had its own
 * guess - the bell panel sent *every* row to `/ws/:slug/leaves`, and a `/me`
 * row went to `/me/ws/:slug` whatever it was about - so a rejected document
 * and a check-in reminder opened the same screen.
 *
 * Deliberately pure: no React, no `next/navigation`, no DB types. That is what
 * lets a route handler build the `data.url` for a push using the exact same
 * function the browser uses for the in-app row, so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * The `type` is the discriminator, not `ref_type`. `ref_type`/`ref_id` name the
 * row a notification points at (`leave_request`, `employee_document`, …) and are
 * accepted here so a future deep link (`…/approvals?focus=<id>`) needs no new
 * signature, but today the destination is decided by family alone.
