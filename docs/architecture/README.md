## Quick Reference - Current State (post overhaul)

### Signal Matching
- **AND semantics** - ALL configured signal types must match. Partial matches don't count.
- `MatchedBy`: `verified` | `partial` | `none` | `override`
- `eventCountsAsOfficePresence()` - also requires no checkout location mismatch

### Auth
- JWT (HS256, 30d) in `cm_session` httpOnly SameSite=Lax cookie
- OTP: 6 digits, 10-min expiry, 5 attempts max, 3 sends per 15 min
- Password reset: OTP-gated via `cm_otp_ok` cookie - never trust client-side `otpVerified`
- API tokens: O(1) prefix lookup (`token_prefix` column + index)

### Notifications
- Stale reminders at 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 18h, 20h, 22h from check-in
- Auto-checkout at **T+12h** from check-in (stored in `scheduled_checkout_at`)
- Web Push (VAPID) for reliable delivery when app is closed
- Web Audio API chime plays regardless of OS notification mode

### Rate Limits
- Login: 10 requests per IP per 15 minutes
- Check-in: 10 per user per hour
- Stored in `rate_limit_log` table (sliding window)

### DB New Tables (added in overhaul)
- `push_subscriptions` - VAPID endpoint per user/device
- `rate_limit_log` - sliding-window rate limiting

### DB New Columns (added in overhaul)
- `presence_events.scheduled_checkout_at` - T+12h from check-in
- `presence_events.checkout_location_mismatch` - distance in metres
- `user_api_tokens.token_prefix` - first 8 chars for O(1) lookup

## Planned / Future Work

| Area | What | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Server-push triggers | Cron-based midnight push from server | `sendPushToUser()` exists, needs a scheduler |
| WiFi signal performance | Replace bcrypt with HMAC-SHA256 for O(1) WiFi comparison | Tracked in `lib/signals.ts` comment |
| Analytics export | CSV download per date range | Gated by plan (`starter`+) |
| Multi-workspace analytics | Cross-workspace rollup for holding companies | Not yet designed |
| Insights charts | Time-bucketed presence visualisation | `/ws/:slug/insights` exists, frontend WIP |
