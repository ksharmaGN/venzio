/**
 * The one active-workspace choice for the whole `/me` surface.
 *
 * An account can hold several active memberships, and Leave, Profile,
 * Documents and the roster all read workspace-scoped endpoints
 * (`/api/me/ws/[slug]/...`), so every one of those screens needs to know
 * *which* workspace it is talking about. That used to be a per-screen `?ws=`
 * dropdown living underneath the shell's workspace pill - two selectors, only
 * one of which did anything. Now the pill is the only selector and this module
 * is what it drives.
 *
 * Resolution order, everywhere:
 *
 *   1. `?ws=<slug>` on the URL  - so existing deep links still land right
 *   2. the `vnz_ws` cookie      - the remembered choice
 *   3. the first active membership
 *
 * The choice is a cookie rather than `localStorage` because `src/app/me/layout.tsx`
 * is a Server Component: it has to know the active workspace to paint the pill
 * on first render, before any client code runs. It is deliberately not
 * httpOnly - it is a UI preference, not a credential.
 *
 * Nothing here decides what the member may *see*. The layout validates the
 * cookie against the caller's real memberships before seeding `initialSlug`,
 * this provider only ever resolves to a slug in that server-supplied list, and
 * every `/api/me/ws/[slug]/*` route re-resolves the slug through its own
 * membership check regardless - so a hand-edited cookie or `?ws=` still 401s.
