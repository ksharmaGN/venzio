 * them automatically: an employee row is only ever created by an admin filling
 * the wizard in. So a directory driven by `employees` shows the handful of
 * people HR has got round to, not the workforce - in the live `globalnodes`
 * workspace that was 1 row out of 34 members.
 *
 * The directory is therefore a list of MEMBERS with the HR record overlaid
 * where one exists. `employee: null` is not an error state, it is simply
 * "nobody has filled this in yet".
 *
 * The rejected alternative was auto-provisioning an `employees` row per member.
 * `employees.last_name` is NOT NULL and 10 of those 34 members hold a
 * single-word name, so it would have meant inventing a surname for a third of
 * the staff and storing it next to their PAN and bank details.
