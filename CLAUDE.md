# Venzio - CLAUDE.md

## Product Overview

Venzio is a **presence intelligence platform**. Two PWA surfaces:
- `/me/*` - mobile-first, individuals record their own presence
- `/ws/:slug/*` - desktop-first, org admins query presence data

**Core USP:** Multi-signal presence verification (AND, not OR). When a workspace has GPS + WiFi + IP signals configured, ALL must match for a check-in to count as verified. This makes faking presence extremely difficult.

**Multi-workspace users:** One account can hold multiple active workspace memberships. `presence_events` rows do not store `workspace_id`; verification is always computed for a chosen workspace. On `/me` that workspace is the **active workspace** (see below), and **`/me/timeline`** is always scoped to it: it calls `GET /api/me/ws/[slug]/events`, which runs `queryWorkspaceEvents()` for that workspace and the current user so transparency matches admin-side AND semantics. The timeline's old **All workspaces** view is gone; `GET /api/events` (unscoped global history, no per-workspace `matched_by`) still exists as an endpoint but has no UI consumer.

---

## The `/me` Surface Conventions

### One workspace selector

The top-bar pill in `src/components/user/MeTopbar.tsx` is the **single source of truth** for the active workspace on `/me`. Every screen below it — home, Timeline, Leave, Profile, Documents, the roster — reads `useWorkspaceScope()` from `src/app/me/workspace-scope.tsx` and scopes its fetches to that slug.

It is backed by the `vnz_ws` cookie (`en.constants.cookieWorkspace`), written from the browser by `workspace-scope.tsx` and read on the server by `resolveActiveWorkspaceSlug()` in `src/app/me/active-workspace.ts`. **Deliberately not httpOnly** — it is a UI preference, not a credential, and `src/app/me/layout.tsx` is a Server Component that must read it to paint the pill correctly on first render. `localStorage` cannot do that.

Resolution order, everywhere: **`?ws=` → cookie → first active membership.** The server validates the value against the memberships it just loaded before seeding the provider, and the provider only ever resolves to a slug in that server-supplied list — a stale or forged value falls back to a real membership rather than naming someone else's workspace. This is UI hygiene, not access control: every `/api/me/ws/[slug]/*` route re-resolves the slug through `requireWsMember()` regardless.

**No screen may add its own workspace picker.** `/me/timeline` used to have one — a second dropdown under the pill, which could disagree with it — and no longer does.

### Workspace naming

Inside content already scoped to the active workspace, **do not print the workspace name**. The pill above already answers "which one", and repeating it is noise (the profile sheet shows the role name, not the workspace).

Where the user is *choosing between* or *comparing* workspaces, the name **stays** — there it is the information, not decoration:
- the switcher sheet in `MeTopbar`
- `/me/orgs` (invites + memberships)
- the `/ws` workspace picker
- the workspace name editor in Settings
- consent invitation emails
- the sole-admin deactivation blocker in `/me/settings` — it lists *which* workspaces are blocking
- the leave-workspace confirm dialog on `/me/orgs` (`en.meOrgs.leaveConfirm(wsName)`)

Scoped to `/me`. The `/ws` admin surface keeps its workspace name in the topbar — it is a different surface with a different question.

### Notification split

Both entry points land on `/me/notifications`; the `?ws=` query param is what distinguishes them.

| Entry point | URL | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Top-bar bell | `/me/notifications?ws=<active slug>` | The active workspace only, no per-row badges — the heading already names it. Polls `GET /api/me/ws/[slug]/notifications/unread-count` |
| Avatar sheet → Notifications | `/me/notifications` | Every workspace, each row badged with its workspace colour. Polls `GET /api/me/notifications/unread-count` |

`?ws=` is validated server-side in `src/app/me/notifications/page.tsx` against real memberships; a bogus slug falls back to the unified view. The client never reads `?ws=` itself. With no workspace at all the bell falls back to the global feed — that is where a pending invitation shows up.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

### 1. No raw SQL in routes
All DB access goes through `lib/db/queries/`. Route handlers call query functions - never `db.query()` directly.

### 2. Server validates everything
The client sends data. The server decides truth. Never trust:
- `userId` from request body (always from JWT via `getServerUser()`)
- `workspaceId` from URL without verifying admin membership
- `otpVerified: true` from client (always verify `cm_otp_ok` cookie server-side)

### 3. All mutations scoped by workspace_id at DB level
Every query that touches workspace data must include `AND workspace_id = ?`. No exceptions. Use `requireWsAccess(request, slug, Resource, Action)` from `@/lib/ws-access` to resolve slug → verified workspace ID before any query.

> `requireWsAdmin()` **no longer exists.** It was a binary "is this person an admin?" check and was removed when the permission model landed; `src/lib/ws-admin.ts` keeps only `requireWsMember()`, which authenticates an ordinary member for the `/me` surface and carries no permission meaning. Re-adding an admin-shaped gate bypasses the role system entirely.

### 4. Event data is immutable
`presence_events` rows are never deleted or modified. Notes are the only editable field on a user's event. Admin corrections live in `admin_overrides`, not in the event itself.

### 5. Soft deletes everywhere
`users.deleted_at`, `workspaces.archived_at`. Never hard-delete user or workspace data. Queries always filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.

---

## Signal Matching - Core Logic

**AND semantics, not OR.** If a workspace has configured multiple signal types, an event is considered "verified" only if it matches ALL configured signal types.

```
Signal types: GPS, WiFi, IP
If workspace has [GPS, WiFi] configured:
  → event must match GPS AND WiFi to be verified
  → matching only GPS = 'partial'
  → matching nothing = 'none' (still returned, just not verified)

Config-light mode (no signals configured):
  → every event from an active member is 'verified' — NOT 'none'
```

Config-light is a deliberate choice, not a fallback: a workspace that has configured nothing has nothing to fail against, so showing its whole team as unverified would be noise. See `src/lib/signals.ts` (`signals.length === 0` branch).

`MatchedBy` values: `'verified'` (all configured signals matched) | `'partial'` (some matched) | `'none'` (no signals matched) | `'override'` (admin override bypassed matching)

Admin overrides (`admin_overrides` table) bypass signal matching entirely. Never apply signal logic to overridden events.

Attendance stats are day-level, not event-level. Use `src/lib/attendance-summary.ts` anywhere WFO/WFH/Leave or office/remote/absent days are shown:
- WFO/office: at least one event that day has `matched_by: 'verified' | 'override'`
- WFH/remote: events exist that day, but none are verified/overridden
- Leave/absent: no event exists for that workspace-local workday
- Multiple events on one day count once, with WFO taking priority over WFH

### Trust signals (collected on both check-in AND checkout)
1. GPS (lat/lng + accuracy)
2. WiFi SSID (bcrypt-hashed - never store raw SSID)
3. IP geolocation (ip-api.com)
4. Device info + timezone

---

## Holiday Calendar

Workspace admins manage a per-workspace holiday list (`workspace_holidays` table). Holidays are soft-deleted (`deleted_at`), always scoped by `workspace_id`. At the database layer, active rows have a partial unique index on `(workspace_id, name, date)` where `deleted_at IS NULL`, so concurrent inserts cannot duplicate the same holiday.

### Admin API (`/api/ws/[slug]/holidays`)
- `GET ?year=YYYY` — list holidays for the given year; omit `year` for all
- `POST` JSON `{ name, date, description? }` — create a single holiday (`date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `POST` multipart `file` — bulk import from CSV or XLSX (≤ 2 MB); upserts by date (one holiday per date)
- `PATCH /[id]` — partial update; at least one of `name`, `date`, `description` required
- `DELETE /[id]` — soft delete; sets `deleted_at`

Duplicate guard: `(name, date)` must be unique per workspace. Returns `409 DUPLICATE` on collision.

### Member API (`/api/me/ws/[slug]/holidays`)
- `GET ?year=YYYY` — read-only; authenticated workspace members only; defaults to current year

### Import file format
Columns (case-insensitive): `name` (required), `date` (required, `YYYY-MM-DD`), `description` (optional).
Rows with a missing/invalid name or date are skipped and returned in the `errors` array; valid rows are always upserted.

---

## Leave System

Workspace admins configure per-workspace leave types (`workspace_leave_types` table). Employees submit leave requests (`leave_requests` table) from `/me/ws/[slug]`. **Submissions land as `pending`, not `approved`** — an admin approves or rejects them from the Approvals queue. Only `approved` requests consume balance.

### Tables
- `workspace_leave_types`: `id, workspace_id, name, accrual_frequency ('monthly'|'quarterly'|'half-yearly'|'yearly'), accrual_credits, credit_timing ('start'|'end'), created_at, deleted_at` — soft-deleted, unique `(workspace_id, name) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
- `leave_requests`: `id, workspace_id, user_id, leave_type_id, start_date, end_date, reason, status DEFAULT 'pending', rejection_reason, actioned_by_user_id, created_at` — dates and type are fixed at insert; only the approve/reject columns ever change
- `leave_opening_balances`: `id, workspace_id, user_id, leave_type_id, balance_days, note, created_at, updated_at` — unique `(workspace_id, user_id, leave_type_id)`; migrated-in balances from whatever system the workspace used before

### Balance computation (no stored balance — always computed)
```
available_days = max(0, opening_balance + total_accrued − used_days)
```
Logic lives in `lib/db/queries/leaves.ts` — `getLeaveTypesWithBalance()` and `computeTotalAccrued()`.

- **Four frequencies**, 1 / 3 / 6 / 12 months per period: `monthly | quarterly | half-yearly | yearly`.
- **Periods are calendar-aligned, not join-date-anchored.** Quarterly boundaries fall on Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct, half-yearly on Jan/Jul, yearly on Jan.
- **The first period is pro-rata**: `accrual_credits × (time from the accrual start to the next period boundary ÷ length of that period)`.
- **`credit_timing` decides when a period's credits land.** `'start'` front-loads — the pro-rata first-period credits are available immediately, and each later period's credits at its start (the in-progress period counts). `'end'` back-loads — nothing until a period completes, so a brand-new member has `0`.
- **Accrual start** is `workspace_members.added_at`, unless the workspace's `leave_cutover_date` is later, in which case that date is used for *every* leave type (Venzio takes over accrual from the cutover).
- **`opening_balance`** is added on top and is independent of the cutover.
- **`used_days` counts *working* days**, not calendar days: `countWorkdays()` from `src/lib/attendance-summary.ts` against the workspace's `working_days`. Only `status = 'approved'` requests count.
- Accrued totals are rounded to one decimal place.

### Admin API (`/api/ws/[slug]/leave-types`)
- `GET` — list active leave types
- `POST` JSON `{ name, accrual_frequency, accrual_credits, credit_timing? }` — create (`credit_timing` defaults to `'start'`)
- `DELETE /[id]` — soft-delete; existing requests unaffected

### Admin approve / reject (`/api/ws/[slug]/leaves`)
- `GET` — all requests for the workspace
- `PATCH /[id]` JSON `{ action: 'approve' | 'reject', rejection_reason? }` — `rejection_reason` is required on reject. `actionLeaveRequest()` updates atomically with `WHERE status = 'pending'`, so a concurrent second action returns `409 ALREADY_ACTIONED` rather than double-processing. Also surfaced through the Approvals queue (`kind: 'leave'`).

### Employee API
- `GET /api/me/ws/[slug]/leave-types` — list types with `available_days` for current user
- `POST /api/me/ws/[slug]/leave` JSON `{ leave_type_id, start_date, end_date, reason? }` — submit as `pending`; returns `400 INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` if the requested *working* days exceed the balance

### Leave requests are append-only
Never delete a `leave_requests` row, and never edit its `start_date`, `end_date`, `leave_type_id` or `user_id`. The **only** mutation allowed is the approve/reject transition out of `pending` — `status`, `rejection_reason`, `actioned_by_user_id` — and it goes through `actionLeaveRequest()`. A correction is a reject plus a new request, never an edit.

## People — one tab, not two

**`/ws/:slug/employees` does not exist.** The HR directory merged into
**`/ws/:slug/people`**, and the sidebar slot it used to occupy is now
**`/ws/:slug/org`**, the reporting tree.

The split was deliberate once — membership and HR records are different jobs with
different risks — and it stopped being real when the employee directory started
listing every member. Two screens then showed the same people from opposite
tables and disagreed on the headcount: the employee side filtered
`status='active' AND user_id IS NOT NULL`, so anyone who had not accepted their
invitation was simply missing from it.

### What People is now

Every `workspace_members` row, with the HR record overlaid where one exists, and
**invited people included**. Server-side search, a department filter and one
status control. Backed by `GET /api/ws/[slug]/members`.

**The permission split survived the merge and is the reason this is not just a
rename:** `members:read` opens the page; `employees:read` is what reveals the HR
columns, and the route **strips those fields server-side** for a viewer without
it. A column omitted from the table while still in the JSON is not a permission
check. The strip is an allow-list, not an omit-list — a deny-list starts leaking
the day someone adds a column to `MemberWithUserFull`.

### The join must survive a NULL user_id

`MEMBER_EMPLOYEE_JOIN` matches on `e.user_id = wm.user_id` **OR**, when the
membership has no user yet, on `lower(e.work_email) = lower(wm.email)`. An
invited person has NULL on both sides and `NULL = NULL` is not true in SQL, so
the id join alone silently drops their HR data until they accept.
`idx_employees_ws_work_email` is UNIQUE per workspace, so the fallback cannot fan
one member out into two rows.

### One status control over two columns

| Filter value | Reads |
|---|---|
| `invited` / `declined` | `workspace_members.status` |
| `active` | active membership **and** (`employee_status = 'active'` **or no record at all**) |
| `terminated` `suspended` `on_leave` `notice_period` | active membership + `employees.employee_status` |

`active` includes a member with no HR record because that is what the table's
status column *labels* them. A filter that disagrees with its own column is
worse than no filter. **Onboarding** and **Probation** are derived from dates and
are display states only — deliberately not filterable.

### Row actions are one link

No role dropdown, no status control, no "Add details" fork. One **Edit** link to
`/ws/:slug/people/[memberId]/details`, plus remove. Changing a role from a
`<select>` inside a table row made a consequential change feel like sorting a
column, and left nowhere to state the consequence.

**The details route is keyed on `workspace_members.id`, not a user id** — an
invited person has no user row, and they are exactly who an admin most needs to
open. It also resolves an `employees.id` in that segment, so the approvals queue
can deep-link a pending document straight to the Documents tab.

Three tabs, three independent gates: **Profile** (`employees:read`),
**Documents** (`documents:read`), **Access** (always — `members:read` opened the
page). Access holds the role select, the reporting-manager select and removal;
they are three writes to three endpoints, never one Save button, because they
land in different tables and fail independently.

### Add employee, then offer the invite

`/ws/:slug/people/new` replaces the old inline "invite someone" email box. An
email address alone was never enough to run payroll, holidays or documents
against, and it left every joiner as a row nobody had filled in.

The record is created **first**, the invitation offered **second** — a cancelled
dialog must not throw a five-step form away. "Send invite" posts to the existing
`POST /api/ws/[slug]/members`; `DOMAIN_AUTO_ENROL` is reported as good news, not
an error. Where an employee record already exists for that address, the consent
email greets them by the name on it.

### Linking the record to the account

An employee record can exist before its person has an account, so
`employees.user_id` stays NULL for the length of an open invitation. The moment
an account appears, `claimEmployeeForUser()` attaches it. `src/lib/membership.ts`
is the shell that owns this: it spans two domains, and `employees.ts` already
imports `workspaces.ts`, so putting it in a query file would close an import
cycle. Every accept path goes through it — consent page, `/api/me/consent`,
registration, verified-domain auto-enrol.

`POST /api/me/consent` now checks the member row's email against the session
email before acting. It previously accepted any `memberId` from any signed-in
caller, which with record-claiming would have handed over somebody else's
decrypted PII.

---

## Reporting hierarchy

**One nullable column is the org chart:** `workspace_members.manager_user_id`.
No join table, one manager per person.

NULL means "not explicitly assigned" and is resolved to the workspace **owner at
read time** (`src/lib/hierarchy.ts`), never written. Storing the owner's id on
every unassigned row would need a rewrite of them all on each ownership
transfer, and would make "never assigned" indistinguishable from "deliberately
reports to the owner".

`employment_details.reporting_manager_id` (→ `employees.id`) is **vestigial**.
The column still exists and the write path still accepts it; nothing reads it as
truth. A hierarchy keyed on employee records would only contain the people HR
has filled in — one row out of 34 in the live workspace.

### `src/lib/hierarchy.ts` is pure

No database access, no imports from the query layer. Callers fetch flat
`(userId, managerUserId)` pairs and hand them in. Deliberately **not** a
recursive CTE: a 500-person company is 500 tiny rows, and doing the walk in
JavaScript means it behaves identically on better-sqlite3 in development and
libSQL in production. `MAX_DEPTH = 64` guards every walk — 64 levels of
management is not a hierarchy, it is corruption.

`buildReportingTree` · `subtreeOf` (includes self) · `ancestorsOf` (excludes
self) · `wouldCreateCycle` · `directReportsOf` · `unassignedMembers`.

The org chart and the write guard use the same module, so the picture and the
refusal can never disagree about who is under whom.

### Routes

- `GET /api/ws/[slug]/hierarchy` — every active member with their manager, plus
  `ownerUserId` (the root; inferring it from `role === 'owner'` client-side
  breaks the moment a custom role is named that)
- `PATCH /api/ws/[slug]/hierarchy` — `{ userId, managerUserId | null }`;
  `409 CYCLE_DETECTED`, `400 SELF_MANAGER`, `400 NOT_A_MEMBER`

**Gated on `Resource.Employees`, not a resource of its own.** ven-112 introduced
a `hierarchy` resource; it was not ported, because adding a Resource means
rewriting every seeded role grid in `system-roles.json` (invariant 12) for a
distinction nobody has asked for. Revisit when a customer wants an HR role that
may hold a record but not restructure the org.

**`Scope.Subtree` was deliberately NOT merged.** Invariant 14 stands: data scope
is the surface, not the role, and every `/ws` role is `Scope.All`.

### Departures re-parent, they do not orphan

`reparentReportsOf()` runs on both exits, and the ORDER differs because the two
paths differ:

| Path | Order | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `DELETE /api/ws/[slug]/members/[memberId]` | **before** the delete | `removeWorkspaceMember` hard-deletes; the row it reads must still exist |
| `DELETE /api/me/workspaces/[workspaceId]` | **after** the leave | `leaveWorkspace` can refuse (sole admin), and the row only goes to `revoked` |

Without it nothing dangles — `buildReportingTree` treats an unknown manager as
absent — but a whole subtree would silently roll up to the owner instead of to
whoever actually inherits them.

### The chart at `/ws/:slug/org`

Hand-rolled, no layout library. A strict tree never needs edge routing that
avoids nodes, which is the only thing a graph engine would buy; connectors are
four `::before`/`::after` borders. Collapse/expand is a `Set` of ids; search
reveals a match by un-collapsing `ancestorsOf()` and centring it. The zoom step
is a `data-zoom` attribute resolved to `--org-zoom` **in `globals.css`** — a
custom property written inline would sit outside the reduced-motion and
touch-target selector lists (invariant 15).

---

## Approvals

**`/ws/:slug/disputes` does not exist.** It was superseded by **`/ws/:slug/approvals`** — one queue holding three kinds of pending item, discriminated by `kind`:

| `kind` | What it is | Backing table |
|---|---|---|
| `leave` | A leave request awaiting action | `leave_requests` |
| `regularization` | An employee asking to correct a past day (`office` / `remote`) | `regularization_requests` |
| `doc` | An employee-uploaded document awaiting verification | `employee_documents` |

`getPendingApprovalItems()` in `src/lib/approvals.ts` is the single source of truth, reused by the Overview widget, the Approvals page and the People page so all three always agree. Routes: `GET /api/ws/[slug]/approvals`, `PATCH /api/ws/[slug]/approvals/[kind]/[id]` — `Resource.Approvals` (`Read` / `Write`; it has no `Delete`).

Approving a regularization does **not** edit a `presence_events` row: it writes an `admin_overrides` row and, where needed, a new regularized event. Invariant 7 still holds.

`kind: 'doc'` items are gated separately: `approvals:read` does **not** imply `documents:read`, so `getPendingApprovalItems()` takes the viewer's role and includes doc items only for a role holding `documents:read`. It is **fail-closed** — omitting the viewer hides the doc items rather than showing them, and the returned `doc` array and `items` are the same shortened truth so every count stays honest.

For a `doc` item, `user_full_name` / `user_email` come from the **employee record**, not the users table — a document can belong to an employee with no linked login yet, and the queue still has to name them.

---

## Assets

Workspace hardware register (`workspace_assets`). Soft-deleted, scoped by `workspace_id`, so a retired laptop's assignment history survives.

Status is one of `assigned | available | repair | retired`, mirrored by a `CHECK` on the column and by `isAssetStatus()` in `lib/db/queries/assets.ts`.

- `GET /api/ws/[slug]/assets` — list + category list + status counts (`?category=`, `?status=`). An unrecognised `status` is *dropped*, not 400'd: otherwise a stale bookmark becomes an error page.
- `POST /api/ws/[slug]/assets` — create. Validation lives in the route's `_validate.ts`; failures return `422 VALIDATION_ERROR` with a `fields` map.
- `PATCH /api/ws/[slug]/assets/[id]` — update · `DELETE` — soft delete
- `POST|DELETE /api/ws/[slug]/assets/[id]/assign` — assign to / unassign from an employee
- `GET /api/ws/[slug]/assets/export` — CSV

**Only the assign endpoint moves a holder.** `PATCH` changes fields; it never sets or clears `assigned_employee_id`. So it refuses both directions of the assignment boundary:

| Attempt | Answer |
|---|---|
| `PATCH` sets `status: 'assigned'` on an asset with no holder | `409 ASSIGN_VIA_ENDPOINT` |
| `PATCH` sets **any** other status on an asset that still has a holder | `409 RETURN_FIRST` |

The second check is keyed on `assigned_employee_id`, **not** on the current status, so a row already in a broken state cannot be patched further sideways. `assigned → retired` is therefore **not** a legal direct edge: `DELETE .../assign` is the only thing that clears a holder, and it is the only way out. `POST .../assign` additionally refuses a `retired` asset (`409 ASSET_RETIRED`) and one already held by someone else (`409 ALREADY_ASSIGNED`).

Guarded by `Resource.Assets` (`Read` / `Write` / `Delete`).

---

## Employee Documents

Two tables, deliberately split: `employee_documents` holds *metadata* (name, type, size, verification state) and is what every list query reads; `employee_document_blobs` holds the bytes and is touched only on upload and download. A join would drag megabytes through every folder view. Metadata is soft-deleted; the blob is **hard**-deleted alongside it — orphaned megabytes for a file nobody can reach are a storage leak, not an audit trail.

### The `DocumentStore` seam — `src/lib/storage.ts`

Bytes live in the database as base64 TEXT today. That is a deliberate trade (one Turso connection, no bucket, no signed URLs, no second failure domain), not a permanent decision, so **every byte enters and leaves through the `DocumentStore` interface**. Swapping in S3 becomes a config change plus one class in that file, touching no query file and no route.

Two rules keep the seam honest:
1. Nothing outside `storage.ts` and `db/queries/documents.ts` may see base64. Callers hand over and receive `Buffer`.
2. Bytes and metadata stay in separate tables (above).

Also in `storage.ts`: `MAX_FILE_BYTES` (2 MB), `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` (`application/pdf`, `image/png`, `image/jpeg`) and `sniffMimeType()`. **MIME type is decided by sniffing magic bytes, never by trusting `File.type`** — that string is attacker-controlled and would let an HTML or SVG payload be stored and served back under a benign `Content-Type`. Anything off the allowlist is a `415`.

`workspaceId` is a parameter on every `DocumentStore` method rather than being implied by the document id: it keeps the tenant boundary visible at the storage layer and would become the S3 key prefix.

### Lifecycle
`owner` is `admin` (company-issued: offer letter, contract → starts `issued`) or `employee` (employee-supplied: ID proof, payslips → `missing` → `pending` on upload → admin verifies). Status: `missing | pending | verified | rejected | issued`.

### Write order — a metadata row never names bytes that are not stored

The blob write and the metadata write cannot be one transaction (they are separate statements today and would be separate *systems* under S3), so the **order** is the correctness argument instead. Both upload routes follow it exactly:

1. **Clear or create the slot with no `file_name`** — an existing slot goes through `clearDocumentFile()`; a new one is created by `createDocument()` with `status: 'missing'` and `file_name` NULL.
2. `documentStore.put()` — write the bytes.
3. `markDocumentUploaded()` — only now does the row claim `file_name` / `mime_type` / `size_bytes`.

A crash at any point leaves either an honest empty slot or the truth — never a download that 404s, and never yesterday's rejected file wearing today's name.

**Delete is the mirror:** soft-delete the metadata first, *then* `documentStore.delete()`. Once the row is soft-deleted nothing can serve the file, so a failed byte delete leaves unreachable orphans rather than a live row pointing at shredded bytes.

Uploading into an occupied slot **replaces** the file on the existing row — a slot is a slot, and a partial unique index on `(workspace_id, employee_id, doc_key)` would reject a second insert anyway. Two uploads racing for the same *new* slot are answered `409 DUPLICATE_SLOT` (`DuplicateDocumentSlotError`), not a 500: the index, not the pre-read, is what decides the winner.

### Upload limits (the `/me` route)
- **20 uploads per hour per user** — `rate_limit_log`, key `documents:<userId>`, action `document_upload`. Checked *before* the body is read, so a rate-limited caller cannot push 2 MB through first. `429 RATE_LIMITED`.
- **40 live slots per employee** — `doc_key` is member-chosen and every unseen key mints a row, so without a ceiling one member can exhaust storage. Replacing the file in a slot they already own is never blocked by it.
- Re-uploading over a `verified` slot is refused (`409 ALREADY_VERIFIED`) — an admin deletes the slot if it genuinely needs replacing.
- The `owner` form field is **ignored** on the `/me` route: always `owner='employee'`, `status='pending'`. Letting a member self-declare a document company-issued would skip verification entirely.

### Routes
- Admin: `GET|POST /api/ws/[slug]/employees/[id]/documents`, `PATCH|DELETE .../[docId]`, `GET .../[docId]/file` — `Resource.Documents`
- Member: `GET|POST /api/me/ws/[slug]/documents`, `GET /api/me/ws/[slug]/documents/[docId]/file` — `requireWsMember()`, self only

The `.../file` routes are the *only* way bytes reach a browser, and they return real bytes with a `Content-Type`. No JSON route ever carries a payload.

---

## Maternity

`maternity_cases` — statutory maternity leave tracked as a **case with stages**, not as a leave request. Deliberately not modelled on `leave_requests`: those are immutable rows booked against an accrued balance, whereas a maternity case spans months, its dates shift as the due date moves, and an admin walks it through a lifecycle. Forcing it into an immutable table would mean deleting and re-creating rows, which those tables forbid.

Stages: `requested → approved → onleave → returned`. Forward-only, one step at a time, so a case cannot jump straight to `returned` and leave no record of the leave starting. The single backward edge `approved → requested` exists because an approval given in error must be revocable before the leave begins. Enforced by `canTransition()` in `lib/db/queries/maternity.ts`.

**One open case per employee**, guaranteed by the partial unique index `idx_maternity_cases_one_open`. `findOpenCaseForEmployee()` in the POST route is only a courtesy that turns the common case into a clean `409 CASE_OPEN` with no failed INSERT behind it — the pre-check and the insert are two statements, so the index is what actually holds. A lost race raises `MaternityCaseOpenError` and gets the same 409. Closed (`returned`) cases are history and do not block a later pregnancy.

**An open case may not have its `start_date` / `end_date` cleared.** The dates, not the status, are the reminder gate: `getActiveMaternityUserIds()` matches `start_date <= today <= end_date`, so a case that keeps its status but loses a date drops silently out of the gate and the daily check-in reminder starts nagging someone on maternity leave. Dates may be *moved* while a case is open; clearing one returns `422 VALIDATION_ERROR` with `REQUIRED_WHILE_OPEN`. Only `returned` — where the gate no longer looks at the case — may hold nulls.

- `GET|POST /api/ws/[slug]/maternity`, `PATCH|DELETE /api/ws/[slug]/maternity/[id]`
- Guarded by **`Resource.Leaves`** — maternity has no resource of its own.

## Billing

There is **no payment integration in this codebase and none is being added.** The plan is a column on the workspace row; "Manage billing" in `src/app/ws/[slug]/settings/BillingTab.tsx` is a deliberate no-op that says so.

Archive and restore live in the same tab because they are gated on the same resource — `Resource.Ownership`, labelled "Ownership & billing" in the catalogue — and it is the only Settings tab shown to owners alone.

---

## Scheduled reminders

Two independent passes, both driven by `POST /api/push/cron` (Bearer `CRON_SECRET`, called from GitHub Actions at :00 and :30).

1. **Event-anchored** (in the cron route): starts from an open `presence_events` row, counts elapsed hours, fires milestone / auto-checkout-warning pushes. Dedupes on `presence_events.push_reminders_sent`.
2. **Wall-clock** (`src/lib/reminders.ts` → `runReminderPass()`): anchors on *workspaces* instead. The event-anchored design structurally cannot notice somebody who never checked in — there is no row to iterate. This pass reads `workspaces.checkin_reminder_at` / `checkout_reminder_at`, works out whether now is that time in the workspace's own timezone, then finds who still owes a check-in or check-out. Dedupes on the `reminder_log` table (unique on `workspace_id, user_id, kind, local_date`).

Everything in pass 2 is about **not nagging**. A reminder that fires on someone's approved leave, on a public holiday or on a Sunday is how a user disables push permanently — which also costs them the approval notifications that work today. Gates, in order:

```
1. workspace archived           → excluded by the query
2. today not a working day      → skip the whole workspace
3. today is a company holiday   → skip the whole workspace
4. now is not near the set time → skip this kind
5. member on approved leave     → skip the member
6. already reminded today       → skip the member (reminder_log)
```

`REMINDER_GRACE_MIN = 90` — how late a reminder may still be delivered. The workflow ticks every 30 min, but GitHub Actions cron is best-effort and routinely runs late; 90 minutes absorbs a skipped tick plus that lag while still refusing to deliver a 10:00 reminder in the afternoon, at which point it is a nag rather than a reminder. `reminder_log` guarantees at most one notification per person, per kind, per local day even with a wide window.

## Database Patterns

### DB abstraction
Always use `lib/db/index.ts` - never import `better-sqlite3` or `@libsql/client` directly.

```ts
import { db } from '@/lib/db'
// db.query(), db.queryOne(), db.execute(), db.transaction()
```

### Query file location
`lib/db/queries/<domain>.ts` - one file per domain:
- `users.ts` - user accounts
- `events.ts` - presence events
- `workspaces.ts` - workspaces + members + overrides
- `signals.ts` - workspace signal configs
- `stats.ts` - user stats
- `tokens.ts` - API tokens (separate from users.ts)
- `push.ts` - push subscriptions
- `holidays.ts` - workspace holiday calendar
- `leaves.ts` - workspace leave types + leave requests (balance computed from member join date)
- `employees.ts` - employee records; sensitive fields (PAN, Aadhaar, bank account) AES-256-GCM encrypted via `src/lib/encryption.ts`
- `employees-list.ts` - the directory/list read path, kept out of `employees.ts` so a list query can never accidentally decrypt sensitive columns
- `assets.ts` - workspace asset register (hardware, assignment history)
- `documents.ts` - employee document metadata **and** the blob helpers; the only file outside `src/lib/storage.ts` allowed to see base64
- `maternity.ts` - maternity cases + their stage machine
- `hierarchy.ts` - the reporting line (`workspace_members.manager_user_id`); the tree walk itself is pure and lives in `src/lib/hierarchy.ts`
- `regularizations.ts` - employee requests to correct a past day
- `roles.ts` - workspace roles and permission grids
- `notifications.ts` - in-app notifications
- `reminders.ts` - the wall-clock reminder pass's reads/writes (`reminder_log`)

### Migration
`scripts/migrate.js` - **single migration script** and must always be **fully up-to-date**.
- Fresh DB: creates every table/column.
- Existing DB: additive `ALTER TABLE` statements add missing columns (wrapped to skip duplicates).
Run: `npm run migrate`.

> **`src/lib/db/schema.ts` was deleted.** There is no TypeScript schema file and no ORM model. `scripts/migrate.js` is the *only* description of the database. To learn what columns a table has, read that script — nothing else in the repo knows. Row shapes are hand-written interfaces inside each query file, and they are documentation, not enforcement: the compiler never checks them against the DB, so a column rename that only touches the interface will typecheck and then fail at runtime.

## Auth System

| Cookie | Purpose | Expiry |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `cm_session` | JWT session (httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, secure in prod) | 30 days |
| `cm_otp_ok` | OTP verified proof (httpOnly) | 15 min |

> **SameSite=Lax** is intentional - `Strict` causes PWA session loss on iOS/Android cold-open (the PWA→browser navigation is treated as cross-origin). `Lax` preserves sessions while still blocking cross-site POST requests.

- JWT carries `jti` (UUID) for revocation - checked on every server-side request via `getSessionFromCookies()`
- Edge middleware (`proxy.ts`) does signature-only verification - fast, no DB hit
- Node.js route handlers call `getSessionFromCookies()` which checks `revoked_tokens` table
- `getServerUser()` reads `x-user-id` / `x-user-email` headers set by proxy

Password: bcryptjs cost 12, minimum 8 chars. Never store plaintext.
WiFi SSID: bcryptjs hash - same library, raw SSID never persisted.

> **Known gap — OTP codes are stored in plaintext.** `otp_codes.code` is a plain `TEXT` column: there is no `code_hash` and no bcrypt anywhere in the OTP path. `getValidOtp()` in `lib/db/queries/users.ts` looks the code up with a literal `AND code = ?`. Anyone with read access to the database can read every live OTP and complete a registration, a login or an ownership transfer as that email. The 10-minute expiry (`otpExpiresAt()` in `src/lib/auth.ts`) and the `used` flag limit the window; they do not close it. Do not describe OTPs as hashed. Fixing this means storing a hash and comparing in code (the `AND code = ?` lookup has to become a fetch-by-email-then-compare), which is a real change to that query — not a doc edit.

---

## Architecture

### Route handlers
- Read user ID from `getServerUser()` (never from request body)
- Gate workspace routes with `requireWsAccess(req, slug, Resource.X, Action.Y)`; on `null` return `forbidden()` (both from `@/lib/ws-access`)
- Gate `/api/me/ws/[slug]/*` routes with `requireWsMember(req, slug)` from `@/lib/ws-admin` — membership, not permission
- Call query functions, return JSON
- Errors: `{ error: "Human message", code: "MACHINE_CODE" }`, consistent HTTP status

`Resource` and `Action` are enums in `src/lib/permissions/catalogue.ts`, not loose strings, so the compiler rejects a guard that names a resource nobody can grant. The screen a route backs is registered in `src/lib/permissions/screens.ts` against the *same* resource — sidebar visibility and route enforcement must agree, and they only do because both read that registry.

### Server vs Client components
- Default: Server Components
- Client only when: interactive state, browser APIs (GPS, Notification), usePathname/useParams
- Never put business logic in Client Components - fetch from API routes instead

### Copy (strings)
- English UI and marketing copy is assembled in `src/locales/en.ts`, but **new copy goes in a per-area module** under `src/locales/en/<area>.ts` (`me.ts`, `me-screens.ts`, `me-settings.ts`, `marketing.ts`, `documents.ts`, `ws-overview.ts`, `ws-people.ts` (which also holds `wsPeopleUi` and `wsOrg`), `ws-settings.ts`, `ws-reminders.ts`). `en.ts` imports each module and spreads it onto the `en` object.
- Both `en.me.x` and `import { me } from '@/locales/en/me'` resolve to the same object, so either import style works at a call site. Prefer the direct module import in new code — it keeps two agents editing two different areas out of the same file.
- The groups still written inline in `en.ts` are the original single-file copy, kept so existing `en.x` call sites keep working. Move a group into a module as its screens are touched; do not add to them.
- Technical identifiers (cookie names, DNS prefixes, DB filenames) live under `en.constants`.

### Layouts
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` - passthrough, public pages
- `src/app/me/layout.tsx` - `.shell-me`: 460px column, `.me-topbar`, `.me-content`, fixed `.me-bottomnav`. Safe-area insets on `html` (top/left/right) and on the bottom nav's padding
- `src/app/ws/[slug]/layout.tsx` → `src/components/ws/WsLayoutClient.tsx` - `.shell-ws`: a sticky **228px sidebar** beside a column carrying the 64px `.ws-topbar` and the 1180px `.ws-content`. **Under 860px the sidebar becomes a horizontally scrolling tab strip** across the top, `.sidebar-foot` is hidden and `.topbar-account` takes over the account menu. The *page* scrolls (sidebar is `position: sticky`), not an inner div, so the topbar's own sticky works and browser scroll restoration behaves
- Sidebar entries come from `visibleScreenGroups()` in `src/lib/permissions/screens.ts` — never a hardcoded nav list. Hiding a tab is a courtesy; the matching route enforces the same permission independently

See `docs/design/shells.md` for the full anatomy.

### SEO and indexing
- Root metadata lives in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Public crawl rules live in `src/app/robots.ts`; the sitemap lives in `src/app/sitemap.ts`.
- Keep `/`, `/for-teams`, `/for-you`, `/pricing`, `/open-source`, `/privacy`, and `/terms` indexable.
- Keep `/login`, `/consent/*`, `/me/*`, `/ws/*`, and `/api/*` non-indexable.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the production canonical origin (`https://venzio.ai`) before deployment so canonical links, Open Graph URLs, robots, and sitemap point at the live domain.

## Design System

Full documentation: **`docs/design/`**. The tokens below are the authoritative summary; the source of truth is `src/app/globals.css`.

The palette is **green**, not blue. Anything in an old doc, mock or component citing `#1B4DFF`, Syne or DM Sans is stale.

| Variable | Value | Use |
|----------|-------|-----|
| `--brand` | `#1d9e75` | Primary buttons, links, active nav, verified state |
| `--brand-hover` | `#157a56` | Hover fill on `.btn-primary` only |
| `--navy` | `#0a2318` | Headings, `.stat-num`, dark text |
| `--teal` | `#00D4AA` | Success accent (toast success dot) |
| `--amber` | `#F59E0B` | Warnings, `partial` status, IP signal |
| `--danger` | `#EF4444` | Errors, destructive, `none` status |
| `--info` | `#2563EB` | `override` status — the one non-green semantic |
| `--surface-0` | `#FFFFFF` | Card and panel backgrounds |
| `--surface-1` | `#f0faf5` | Page backgrounds |
| `--surface-2` | `#e4f5ec` | Inputs, tracks, hover fills |
| `--text-primary` | `#0a2318` | Body text |
| `--text-secondary` | `#3d6b52` | Labels, secondary text |
| `--text-muted` | `#7aab92` | Hints, eyebrows, empty states |
| `--border` | `rgba(29,158,117,0.18)` | All borders — a translucent green, not a grey |
| `--header-bg` | `#0d2118` | Dark chrome (toast background) |
| `--ring` | `rgba(29,158,117,0.28)` | Focus rings, signal-dot halos, stepper glow |
| `--green-glow` | `rgba(29,158,117,0.18)` | Marketing ambient blobs **only** — weaker on purpose |
| `--radius-sm/md/lg/xl` | `6 / 10 / 16 / 22px` | Chips+icon buttons / controls / cards / overlay panels |
| `--shadow-sm` | `0 1px 2px rgba(10,35,24,0.06)` | Active tab pill |
| `--shadow-md` | `0 4px 16px rgba(10,35,24,0.08)` | Modal, dropdown, toast |
| `--ease-out` | `cubic-bezier(0.23,1,0.32,1)` | Default exit/settle |
| `--ease-inout` | `cubic-bezier(0.77,0,0.175,1)` | Long symmetric moves (check-in rings) |
| `--ease-spring` | `cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)` | Overshoot — toggle knob, modal, toast |
| `--ease-drawer` | `cubic-bezier(0.32,0.72,0,1)` | Bottom sheet only |

Fonts: **Playfair Display** (headings), **Plus Jakarta Sans** (body), **JetBrains Mono** (`.stat-num`, code, timestamps).

Rules:
- **No shadows on inline surfaces.** Cards, inputs, chips, rows and tables are separated by `--border` alone. Elevation exists only where something floats *above* the page: toasts, modals, slide-overs, bottom sheets, dropdowns and the active `.tabbar` pill. A shadow on a card is a bug; a shadow on a modal is the design.
- No gradients — flat fills. (The marketing surface under `src/app/(public)/` and `src/components/*` landing components is exempt and keeps its own Tailwind styling.)
- **Minimum touch target 44px, enforced globally and uniformly** — `.btn`, `.btn-sm`, `.icon-btn`, `.tabbar button`, `.dropzone`, `.me-navitem` all carry `min-height: 44px` (`.icon-btn` also `min-width`). This is stricter than WCAG 2.2 AA (24px) and matches Apple HIG / WCAG 2.1 AAA. It applies on desktop too: an admin clearing an approvals queue on a phone gets the same target as a member checking in, and it deliberately costs some of the mock's table density.
  - **One exception, `.toggle`:** it keeps its 42×25 visual and gets a 44×44 hit area from a transparent `::after` overlay. Stretching a switch track to 44px tall reads as a broken control. The rule governs the *hit area*, not the paint.
- Skeleton loaders for async, never spinners. `Button` deliberately has no spinner — it sets `aria-busy` and dims its label.
- Tailwind CSS v4, utility-only — no component libraries.
- **Styling lives in `globals.css` or in a `src/components/ui/` primitive.** Never a per-component `<style>` block, never an ad-hoc inline style object. See invariant 15.

## Plan Limits (lib/plans.ts)

| Plan | Max Users | History | Locations | CSV |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
| `free` | 10 | 3 months | 1 | No |
| `starter` | unlimited | 12 months | 1 | Yes |
| `growth` | unlimited | 7 years | 5 | Yes |

`maxUsers` and `historyMonths` are enforced in `queryWorkspaceEvents()` - the plan gate is applied before signal matching.

**`maxLocations` is advisory today, not enforced.** It exists in `src/lib/plans.ts` and is displayed by `src/app/ws/[slug]/settings/BillingTab.tsx`, but `POST /api/ws/[slug]/signals` never counts existing rows, so any workspace can add any number of location signals. Treat the column as a marketing figure until that route grows a count check.

---

## Key Invariants

1. **User ID never from client** - always from `x-user-id` header (proxy-set from JWT)
2. **Workspace scoping** - slug → workspace.id via `requireWsAccess(req, slug, Resource, Action)`, then all queries use `ctx.workspace.id`. Never `requireWsAdmin()` — it does not exist.
3. **OTP registration** - `cm_otp_ok` cookie must be present + valid before account creation
4. **Consent validation** - 3 checks: status=pending_consent, token not expired, logged-in email matches invited email
5. **Location labels** - set asynchronously post-check-in via Nominatim. May be NULL - that's acceptable, not a bug
6. **Checkout signals** - GPS/WiFi/IP collected at checkout too. Both check-in AND checkout signals stored
7. **Admin overrides** - stored in `admin_overrides` table, never modify original `presence_events` row
8. **Rate limiting** - `rate_limit_log` table: IP-keyed for login (10 attempts per 15 min), user-keyed for checkin (10 per hr). Use `getRateLimitCount` + `recordRateLimitHit` from `lib/db/queries/users.ts`.
9. **API token O(1) lookup** - `token_prefix` column stores first 8 chars of the raw token. Always use prefix lookup in `POST /api/v1/checkin`. Never skip it.
10. **Every workspace has its system roles** - permissions resolve by joining `workspace_members.role` → `workspace_roles`, so a workspace with no rows in `workspace_roles` grants *nobody* anything, its creator included. `createWorkspace()` seeds owner/admin/member via `seedSystemRoles()` in the same transaction as the workspace row. Never insert a workspace by any other path.
11. **The workspace creator is the `owner`** - not an `admin`. Only `owner` holds the `ownership` resource (transfer, archive, billing), so a workspace whose creator is an admin has nobody who can do those things.
12. **One definition of the seeded grids** - `src/lib/permissions/system-roles.json`, read by both the app (`system-roles.ts`) and `scripts/migrate.js`. Never write a second copy: the app and the migration drifting apart is exactly what shipped every new workspace with no roles.
13. **You can only hand out permissions you hold** - `guardEscalation()` runs on role *create*, role *edit* AND role *assignment* (`PATCH /members/[id]/role`). Rank is not a ceiling on its own: every custom role shares `CUSTOM_ROLE_RANK`, so rank alone lets any custom role with `members.role:write` assign any other custom role, however powerful. Never gate an assignment on rank alone.
14. **Data scope is the surface, not the role** - `/me/*` is always self-only, for every role, decided by the session user ID with no role lookup. So `Scope.Self` means "no org surface at all" (only the seeded `member` role carries it) and every `/ws` role is `Scope.All`. The roles builder offers no choice, and routes set scope server-side rather than accepting one from the client.
15. **Styling has exactly two homes** - a class in `src/app/globals.css`, or a primitive in `src/components/ui/`. Never a per-component `<style>` block and never an ad-hoc inline style object. The reason is mechanical, not aesthetic: the reduced-motion guard, the 44px touch-target rule and the elevation rule are all written as selector lists in `globals.css`, so a style declared anywhere else is invisible to them and silently exempt. If a primitive needs a class the stylesheet does not have, add the class — do not inline it. (Known exceptions, all pre-dating this rule: `src/components/shared/Toast.tsx` and `TopProgressBar.tsx`, `src/app/ws/[slug]/members/[memberId]/page.tsx`, and the marketing components, which are outside the app design system.)
16. **Copy lives in a locale module** - new user-facing strings go in `src/locales/en/<area>.ts` and are composed into `en` by `src/locales/en.ts`. Never a literal in a component or route, and never a new inline group in `en.ts`.
17. **The workforce directory is ONE screen** - `/ws/:slug/people`. Never re-add an
    employees tab. `members:read` opens it; `employees:read` is what reveals the HR
    columns, and `GET /api/ws/[slug]/members` strips them server-side with an
    **allow-list** rather than omitting them in the table. Invited people
    (`status = 'pending_consent'`) belong in it, which is why the member/employee
    join carries a work-email fallback: both sides are NULL before they accept.
18. **The reporting line lives on `workspace_members.manager_user_id`** - one
    nullable column, NULL resolved to the owner at READ time and never written.
    `employment_details.reporting_manager_id` is vestigial; do not start reading it.
    Every walk goes through `src/lib/hierarchy.ts`, which is pure, so the org chart
    and the cycle guard cannot disagree.
19. **An employee record may exist before its account does** - so `employees.user_id`
    is NULL for the length of an open invitation and the directory finds the row by
    work email. Every accept path must go through `src/lib/membership.ts`, which
    claims the record. A new accept path that skips it leaves a permanently
    unlinked record.
20. **Document bytes never appear in a JSON response** - every file goes in and out through the `DocumentStore` seam in `src/lib/storage.ts` as a `Buffer`, and comes back to the browser from a dedicated `.../file` route with real bytes and a `Content-Type`. Nothing outside `storage.ts` and `db/queries/documents.ts` may see base64. Putting a payload into a JSON body would also drag megabytes through every list query and turn the S3 swap from a one-file change into a rewrite.

---

## What NOT to Do

- Never call `db.query()` / `db.execute()` outside of `lib/db/queries/`
- Never accept `userId` or `workspaceId` from request body/params without verification
- Never delete presence_events rows
- Never store raw WiFi SSIDs
- Never skip `requireWsAccess(req, slug, Resource, Action)` on a `/api/ws/[slug]/*` route — and never reintroduce `requireWsAdmin()`
- Never put a shadow on an inline surface (cards, inputs, chips, rows); shadows are for overlays only
- Never add gradients to app UI
- Never write a `<style>` block in a component or an ad-hoc inline style object — add a class to `globals.css`
- Never return document bytes (or base64) in a JSON response body
- Never trust `otpVerified: true` from client
- Never use spinners - use skeleton loaders
- Never add a second workspace picker to a `/me` screen — the top-bar pill is the only one
- Never print the workspace name inside `/me` content already scoped to the active workspace
- Never seed a workspace colour on the slug — `swatchColor()` takes the workspace **id**
- Never change an asset's status while it still has a holder — return it via `DELETE .../assign` first
- Never re-add an Employees tab, or a second directory of the same people
- Never add a role or status control to a directory row — those live on the details page
- Never key the person details route on a user id — an invited person has none
- Never read `employment_details.reporting_manager_id` as the reporting line
- Never accept a `memberId` from the client without checking it belongs to the caller
- Never look for `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — it is deleted; read `scripts/migrate.js`
