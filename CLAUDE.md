# Venzio - CLAUDE.md

## Product Overview

Venzio is a **presence intelligence platform**. Two PWA surfaces:
- `/me/*` - mobile-first, individuals record their own presence
- `/ws/:slug/*` - desktop-first, org admins query presence data

**Core USP:** Multi-signal presence verification (AND, not OR). When a workspace has GPS + WiFi + IP signals configured, ALL must match for a check-in to count as verified. This makes faking presence extremely difficult.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

### 1. No raw SQL in routes
All DB access goes through `lib/db/queries/`. Route handlers call query functions - never `db.query()` directly.

### 2. Server validates everything
The client sends data. The server decides truth. Never trust:
- `userId` from request body (always from JWT via `getServerUser()`)
- `workspaceId` from URL without verifying admin membership
- `otpVerified: true` from client (always verify `cm_otp_ok` cookie server-side)

### 3. All mutations scoped by workspace_id at DB level
Every query that touches workspace data must include `AND workspace_id = ?`. No exceptions. Use `requireWsAdmin()` to resolve slug → verified workspace ID before any query.

### 4. Event data is immutable
`presence_events` rows are never deleted or modified. Notes are the only editable field on a user's event. Admin corrections live in `admin_overrides`, not in the event itself.

### 5. Soft deletes everywhere
`users.deleted_at`, `workspaces.archived_at`. Never hard-delete user or workspace data. Queries always filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.

## Signal Matching - Core Logic

**AND semantics, not OR.** If a workspace has configured multiple signal types, an event is considered "verified" only if it matches ALL configured signal types.

```
Signal types: GPS, WiFi, IP
If workspace has [GPS, WiFi] configured:
  → event must match GPS AND WiFi to be verified
  → matching only GPS = unverified
  → matching nothing = not counted at all

Config-light mode (no signals configured):
  → all events from active members pass through
```

`MatchedBy` values: `'verified'` (all configured signals matched) | `'partial'` (some matched) | `'none'` (no signals matched) | `'override'` (admin override bypassed matching)

Admin overrides (`admin_overrides` table) bypass signal matching entirely. Never apply signal logic to overridden events.

Attendance stats are day-level, not event-level. Use `src/lib/attendance-summary.ts` anywhere WFO/WFH/Leave or office/remote/absent days are shown:
- WFO/office: at least one event that day has `matched_by: 'verified' | 'override'`
- WFH/remote: events exist that day, but none are verified/overridden
- Leave/absent: no event exists for that workspace-local workday
- Multiple events on one day count once, with WFO taking priority over WFH

### Trust signals (collected on both check-in AND checkout)
1. GPS (lat/lng + accuracy)
2. WiFi SSID (bcrypt-hashed - never store raw SSID)
3. IP geolocation (ip-api.com)
4. Device info + timezone

## Database Patterns

### DB abstraction
Always use `lib/db/index.ts` - never import `better-sqlite3` or `@libsql/client` directly.

```ts
import { db } from '@/lib/db'
// db.query(), db.queryOne(), db.execute(), db.transaction()
```

### Query file location
`lib/db/queries/<domain>.ts` - one file per domain:
- `users.ts` - user accounts
- `events.ts` - presence events
- `workspaces.ts` - workspaces + members + overrides
- `signals.ts` - workspace signal configs
- `stats.ts` - user stats
- `tokens.ts` - API tokens (separate from users.ts)
- `push.ts` - push subscriptions

### Migration
`scripts/migrate.js` - idempotent. `ALTER TABLE` wrapped in try/catch. Run: `node scripts/migrate.js`.

## Auth System

| Cookie | Purpose | Expiry |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `cm_session` | JWT session (httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, secure in prod) | 30 days |
| `cm_otp_ok` | OTP verified proof (httpOnly) | 15 min |

> **SameSite=Lax** is intentional - `Strict` causes PWA session loss on iOS/Android cold-open (the PWA→browser navigation is treated as cross-origin). `Lax` preserves sessions while still blocking cross-site POST requests.

- JWT carries `jti` (UUID) for revocation - checked on every server-side request via `getSessionFromCookies()`
- Edge middleware (`proxy.ts`) does signature-only verification - fast, no DB hit
- Node.js route handlers call `getSessionFromCookies()` which checks `revoked_tokens` table
- `getServerUser()` reads `x-user-id` / `x-user-email` headers set by proxy

Password: bcryptjs cost 12, minimum 8 chars. Never store plaintext.
WiFi SSID: bcryptjs hash - same library, raw SSID never persisted.

---

## Architecture

### Route handlers
- Read user ID from `getServerUser()` (never from request body)
- Validate admin role via `requireWsAdmin(req, slug)` for workspace routes
- Call query functions, return JSON
- Errors: `{ error: "Human message", code: "MACHINE_CODE" }`, consistent HTTP status

### Server vs Client components
- Default: Server Components
- Client only when: interactive state, browser APIs (GPS, Notification), usePathname/useParams
- Never put business logic in Client Components - fetch from API routes instead

### Layouts
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` - passthrough, public pages
- `src/app/me/layout.tsx` - user PWA shell (header + bottom nav)
- `src/app/ws/[slug]/layout.tsx` - org PWA shell (header + tab nav)

### SEO and indexing
- Root metadata lives in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Public crawl rules live in `src/app/robots.ts`; the sitemap lives in `src/app/sitemap.ts`.
- Keep `/`, `/for-teams`, `/for-you`, `/pricing`, `/open-source`, `/privacy`, and `/terms` indexable.
- Keep `/login`, `/consent/*`, `/me/*`, `/ws/*`, and `/api/*` non-indexable.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the production canonical origin (`https://venzio.ai`) before deployment so canonical links, Open Graph URLs, robots, and sitemap point at the live domain.

## Design System

CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`:

| Variable | Value | Use |
|----------|-------|-----|
| `--brand` | `#1B4DFF` | Primary buttons, links |
| `--navy` | `#0D1B2A` | Headings, dark text |
| `--teal` | `#00D4AA` | Present/verified status |
| `--amber` | `#F59E0B` | Warnings, IP signal |
| `--danger` | `#EF4444` | Errors, destructive |
| `--surface-0` | `#FFFFFF` | Card backgrounds |
| `--surface-1` | `#F8FAFC` | Page backgrounds |
| `--surface-2` | `#F1F5F9` | Input backgrounds |
| `--border` | `#E2E8F0` | All borders |

Fonts: Syne (headings), DM Sans (body), JetBrains Mono (code/timestamps).

Rules:
- No drop shadows - borders only
- No gradients - flat fills
- Minimum touch target: 44px height
- Skeleton loaders for async, never spinners
- Tailwind CSS v4, utility-only - no component libraries

---

## Plan Limits (lib/plans.ts)

| Plan | Max Users | History | Locations | CSV |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
| `free` | 10 | 3 months | 1 | No |
| `starter` | unlimited | 12 months | 1 | Yes |
| `growth` | unlimited | 7 years | 5 | Yes |

Enforce in `queryWorkspaceEvents()` - plan gate applied before signal matching.

---

## Key Invariants

1. **User ID never from client** - always from `x-user-id` header (proxy-set from JWT)
2. **Workspace scoping** - slug → workspace.id via `requireWsAdmin()`, then all queries use workspace.id
3. **OTP registration** - `cm_otp_ok` cookie must be present + valid before account creation
4. **Consent validation** - 3 checks: status=pending_consent, token not expired, logged-in email matches invited email
5. **Location labels** - set asynchronously post-check-in via Nominatim. May be NULL - that's acceptable, not a bug
6. **Checkout signals** - GPS/WiFi/IP collected at checkout too. Both check-in AND checkout signals stored
7. **Admin overrides** - stored in `admin_overrides` table, never modify original `presence_events` row
8. **Rate limiting** - `rate_limit_log` table: IP-keyed for login (10 attempts per 15 min), user-keyed for checkin (10 per hr). Use `getRateLimitCount` + `recordRateLimitHit` from `lib/db/queries/users.ts`.
9. **API token O(1) lookup** - `token_prefix` column stores first 8 chars of the raw token. Always use prefix lookup in `POST /api/v1/checkin`. Never skip it.

---

## What NOT to Do

- Never call `db.query()` / `db.execute()` outside of `lib/db/queries/`
- Never accept `userId` or `workspaceId` from request body/params without verification
- Never delete presence_events rows
- Never store raw WiFi SSIDs
- Never skip `requireWsAdmin()` for workspace admin routes
- Never add drop shadows or gradients to UI
- Never trust `otpVerified: true` from client
- Never use spinners - use skeleton loaders
