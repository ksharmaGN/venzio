/**
 * The document storage seam.
 *
 * Employee documents are small, private files (offer letters, ID scans,
 * payslips). Today they live in the database as base64 TEXT, which keeps the
 * whole product on a single Turso connection with no bucket, no signed URLs
 * and no second failure domain to operate. That is a deliberate trade for the
 * current scale, not a permanent decision - so every byte enters and leaves
 * through the `DocumentStore` interface below. Swapping in an S3-backed
 * implementation is then a config change plus one new class in this file,
 * touching no query file and no route.
 *
 * Two rules keep that seam honest:
 *
 *   1. Nothing outside this file and `db/queries/documents.ts` may see base64.
 *      Callers hand over and receive `Buffer`. If a route ever string-handles
 *      the payload, the S3 swap stops being a one-file change.
 *   2. Bytes and metadata live in separate tables. `employee_documents` is
 *      listed on every folder view; `employee_document_blobs` is read only
 *      when someone actually downloads a file. A join would drag megabytes
 *      through every list query.
 *   3. Every byte that is written OR removed goes through this interface,
 *      `delete` included. A raw `DELETE FROM employee_document_blobs` in a
 *      query file reads as harmless today and deletes nothing at all the day
 *      the store is S3 - the metadata disappears and the object leaks forever.
 *
 * Ordering, since the two halves cannot share a transaction (the DB store's
 * blob write and the metadata write are separate statements, and an S3 PUT
 * could never join a SQL transaction at all):
 *
 *   upload  put() FIRST, then let the metadata row claim the file. A row must
 *           never name bytes that are not stored yet. Replacing an occupied
 *           slot therefore drops the old claim before overwriting, so a crash
 *           leaves an empty slot rather than an old file under a new name.
 *   delete  Soft-delete the metadata FIRST, then delete(). A crash then leaves
 *           bytes nobody can reach, rather than a live row with no file.
 *
 * Both orderings fail towards "no file", which every surface already handles,
 * and away from "a file that is not what the row says it is", which nothing
 * can detect after the fact.
 *
 * Chunking: none, on purpose. A 2.79 MB base64 row (≈2 MB raw, the cap below)
 * has been verified to round-trip through Turso intact, so splitting payloads
 * across rows would add reassembly logic to buy nothing. If the cap is ever
 * raised past Turso's row/response limits, that is the moment to reach for S3
 * rather than for a chunking scheme.
